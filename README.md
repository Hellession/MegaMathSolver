# MegaMathSolver
Java Project designed to solve mathematical expressions and equations from a simple string input.

The goal of this project is to make the following -
You enter an expression, equation or a function and:
* Expressions must be automatically solved - if that's impossible, at least it has to be simplified; same should happen with rational expressions.
* Equations must be automatically solved - no matter how many results there can be. If it is impossible, it should also inform of that.
* Functions must return an endless amount of y, no matter which x you enter(unless it is invalid, ex. f(x)=6/x and you input x=0)

Progress:

* The String parser for Expressions (ONLY) so far is complete.
* The Expression solver method is currently under work.
* Equation support isn't available yet.
* Function support isn't available yet.
* Version v0.2.1(awaiting your review)

All Pull Requests will be merged automatically within 3 days of the initial creation, if no opinions or issues appear.
